Steganography Technique: Least Significant Bit (LSB) modification.

This project demonstrates the successful implementation of LSB-based steganography for secure data hiding in images. 
The results show that it is possible to embed a significant amount of data within images without introducing noticeable artifacts, providing a reliable method for covert communication.  
The project also highlights the importance of considering security best practices, such as encryption, to enhance the robustness of steganographic systems.
